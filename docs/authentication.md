# Authentication Flow Overview

## Legacy CD-Key Handling

Quake Live inherited Quake III Arena's CD-key workflow. The client stores a 32 character key in `cl_cdkey` and forwards a sanitized version to the authorization service via the `getKeyAuthorize` out-of-band packet. The filtering previously lived entirely inside `CL_RequestAuthorization` in `cl_main.c`, which trimmed non-alphanumeric characters from `cl_cdkey` before contacting the master server.【F:src/code/client/cl_main.c†L888-L928】

The CD-key values themselves are persisted and validated in the common layer. `Com_ReadCDKey` and `Com_AppendCDKey` pull data from `q3key` files and rely on `CL_CDKeyValidate` to guard against malformed input, while `Com_WriteCDKey` saves a sanitized value back to disk.【F:src/code/qcommon/common.c†L2238-L2312】

## New Credential Abstraction

### Credential Structures and Enums

`src/common/auth_credentials.{c,h}` formalizes every credential-related data structure that higher layers interact with.【F:src/common/auth_credentials.h†L7-L47】 Key items include:

- `qlAuthCredentialKind` enumerates supported credential sources. The initial set covers the legacy CD-key plus Steam- and standalone-launcher tokens, with `QL_AUTH_CREDENTIAL_EMPTY` reserved for blank/invalid states.【F:src/common/auth_credentials.h†L7-L21】
- `ql_auth_credential_t` couples a `kind`, byte buffer, and tracked length so calling code can treat credentials generically while preserving platform-specific prefixes.【F:src/common/auth_credentials.h†L17-L21】
- `qlAuthResult`, `qlAuthOutcome`, and `ql_auth_response_t` capture both low-level transport status and high-level outcomes (success, retry, failure), ensuring callers can react appropriately to transient or fatal errors.【F:src/common/auth_credentials.h†L25-L38】

Helper routines centralize conversions between raw strings and the new structures:

- `QL_ParseCredentialString` resolves user-provided text into a typed credential, detecting `steam:` or `standalone:` prefixes before falling back to the CD-key sanitizer used in older builds.【F:src/common/auth_credentials.c†L68-L82】
- `QL_FormatCredentialForAuthorize` serializes a credential for network transport, re-applying prefixes only when needed so that legacy servers still see bare CD-key payloads.【F:src/common/auth_credentials.c†L137-L164】
- `QL_RequestExternalAuth` now delegates to the client online-services dispatcher. The helper clears the response, calls into `QL_Auth_ExecuteRequest`, and preserves legacy success semantics for local CD-key validation.【F:src/common/auth_credentials.c†L120-L154】【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L245-L318】

### Integration with Existing Client/Server Code

The client’s authorization path (`CL_RequestAuthorization`) now builds its payload through the new abstraction. After honoring `fs_restrict`, the code parses `cl_cdkey` into a `ql_auth_credential_t` and formats it for the out-of-band `getKeyAuthorize` request, allowing Steam or standalone tokens to flow through unchanged.【F:src/code/client/cl_main.c†L886-L918】

On the server side, the authorize challenge code continues to expect raw strings returned by the master server (`SV_GetChallenge` / `SV_AuthorizeIpPacket`). Once external validation is available, these functions will be responsible for interpreting the credential labels and handling non-CD-key responses coming back from the backend.【F:src/code/server/sv_client.c†L52-L205】【F:src/code/server/sv_client.c†L142-L204】

## Credential Consumers That Require Updates

Several legacy code paths still assume CD-keys are the only credential format. Migrating them to the new abstraction will unblock platform tokens and reduce duplicated sanitization logic:

- **Disk persistence (`Com_ReadCDKey`, `Com_AppendCDKey`, `Com_WriteCDKey`)** – These helpers currently store two 16-character halves of a CD-key and rely on `CL_CDKeyValidate`. They need to learn how to serialize credential kind metadata (e.g., prefixes or structured files) and skip CD-key specific validation when non-legacy kinds are present.【F:src/code/qcommon/common.c†L2238-L2342】
- **Client configuration (`cl_cdkey` cvar and mutation helpers)** – The cvar still holds raw CD-key text, and UI utilities swap 16-character blocks around the buffer. Both the cvar definition and helper routines (such as the swapper in `cl_ui.c`) should be reworked to store full credential strings, including platform prefixes, without chunking them into CD-key segments.【F:src/code/qcommon/cvar.c†L642-L668】【F:src/code/client/cl_ui.c†L693-L716】
- **In-game UI (`ui_cdkey.c`, setup and menu flows)** – Menu widgets validate and split CD-keys into four 4-character sections before calling `trap_SetCDKey`. Updating these screens to surface credential type selectors (or entirely hiding the entry fields when external platforms supply tokens) will align the UI with the new abstraction.【F:src/code/q3_ui/ui_cdkey.c†L73-L253】
- **Server authorization messages** – `SV_GetChallenge` and `SV_AuthorizeIpPacket` implicitly treat credentials as CD-keys when composing status strings (`demo`, `accept`, `unknown`). Once the backend starts returning typed credentials or richer denial reasons, these handlers should inspect the credential label and forward human-readable errors to clients, instead of hard-coding CD-key terminology.【F:src/code/server/sv_client.c†L117-L205】

Addressing the above components centralizes credential awareness and prevents legacy assumptions from leaking into platform-specific integrations.

## Client Online Services Dispatch

`src/code/client/ql_auth.c` implements the first concrete request handlers for Steam and standalone launchers. Each handler logs the lifecycle, summarizes the credential without leaking the full token, and sets the response with a structured outcome.【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L15-L225】【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L245-L318】 Steam tickets shorter than 16 bytes are denied immediately, tokens containing `retry` trigger a pending outcome so callers can refresh, and any payload flagged as `denied` or `invalid` maps to a failure.【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L111-L163】 Standalone launchers use similar heuristics for expirations (`refresh`) and revocations (`revoke`/`denied`).【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L166-L195】

Both transports emit human-readable log entries in the form `[auth] <provider> result -> outcome=<...>` so integration tests and support tooling can track every stage of the exchange.【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L62-L83】【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L274-L318】 The dispatcher falls back to an error outcome for unknown credential kinds while reusing the shared `QL_GetCredentialLabel` helper for diagnostics.【F:src/code/client/ql_auth.c†L303-L318】
